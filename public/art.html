Users answer the displayed arithmetic question, which increases in difficulty every level. Users submit their answer by pressing the submit button, or pressing the enter key on their keyboard. If the user answers correctly, a new problem will be randomly generated.</p>
<p>The number of currently consecutive answers is stored, and it is displayed under &quot;Current Streak&quot; on the webpage. The user&#39;s highest streak for the session is also displayed, which is reset when the page is refreshed/a new session starts.</p>
<p>For every correctly answered question, the screen displays &quot;Correct! Great Job!&quot; with an accompanying image of the original avatar, Mathy the Adventure Cat, randomly displaying 1 of 3 positive emotions. Every 10 correct consecutive answers is rewarded with unlocking a new background.</p>
<p>When users enter incorrectly, the current streak is reset to 0, and the question will not change until it is answered correctly. Mathy the Adventure Cat is displayed as having a pensive, thinking face.</p>
<p>When users need help, they can press the help button in the top right of the div container. This alerts the user of some ways to help them solve the problem.</p>
<p>For users who have sight impairments or struggle with dyscalculia, there is a speech-to-text toggle button displayed under the current level.</p>
