This immersive digital experience complements the performer's physical presence, creating a seamless bridge between the digital and physical realms of artistic expression.

## Source Consume

- tags: [installation, activism]

This project creates a direct connection between fashion consumption and its environmental impact by transporting viewers to various locations affected by overconsumption, including manufacturing sites, waste dumps, and natural areas under threat.

## Infinite Podcast
- date: 2024-12-07
- description: A generative audio piece that infinitely chops and screws true crime podcasts together, creating an endless stream of fragmented narratives.
- link: https://ttarigh.github.io/infinite-podcast/
- link_text: Listen to Infinite Podcast
- images: [infinite-podcast.webp]
- tags: [web, installation]

Created for the Rusty Utopia group show by [Artists Quarters](https://www.instagram.com/artistsquarters/), this piece examines our cultural obsession with true crime content by algorithmically remixing it into an unsettling, never-ending stream.

## ‚òÜ Say One More Thing
- date: 2024-10-15
- description: An email lottery system with a 1 in one million chance that your message goes through, garnering over 5 million views and 10,000+ users.
- link: https://say-one-more-thing.com/
- link_text: Try Your Luck
- images: [say-one-more-thing.webp]
- tags: [web, interactive, viral]

This project explores digital communication, chance, and the value we place on having our voices heard. The campaign spread through social media with viral videos explaining the concept:
- [Interviewing People in WSP](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DCsXAp0xdGy/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==)
- [Marketing Video for the Tool](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DCNc_ZpxKj5/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==)

New entries continue to arrive daily, with participants hoping to be the rare voice that breaks through.

## SuperVitamin
- date: 2024-06-23
- description: My inspirations for "SuperVitamin" were: 1) an ex who would take a bunch of supplements at the same time (like a handful of 20 pills, AT ONCE!!) and 2) a time period where I was completely enthralled with online manifestation videos.
- link: https://tina.zone/vitamin/
- link_text: Take Your Vitamins
- images: [supervitamin.webp]
- tags: [web, interactive]

To manifest my dream job, I spent nearly an hour each morning listening to three back-to-back videos. Patience isn't my virtue, so why not binge all these good vibes at once? That curiosity plunged me into YouTube's manifestation rabbit hole, where you can manifest anything. Forget just the dream job‚Äîhow about changing your eye color, winning the lottery, or nailing a backflip? The possibilities are endless, with countless frequencies and soothing voices guiding the way.

Use this tool as a menu, pick out everything you want to manifest and listen to the cacophony of your every desire.

## Enter Here
- date: 2024-06-10
- description: This is a little install I did for @pixelmouthnyc called "A rose for @Emily7213_lol"

- link_text: ENTER HERE
- images: [enter.webp]
- tags: [installation, video]

It's an immersive viewing experience that dynamically switches between different real-time live streams worldwide while physically encapsulating you in the soft-sculpture. The portals transition between remote sea cameras, zoo animals, random backyards, ASMR, porn cams, MIT's cafeteria, bomb watches in Gaza, UN meetings, mukbang channels, urban city streets, game shows, stock watches, and so SO much more. It also featured a security camera watching the viewer from a location within the gallery.

This project highlights both the interconnectedness of our digital-age existence and the pervasive nature of modern surveillance. You are the observer and the observed. Thanks so much @tench.nology for getting me involved. It was such an honor and the show was fabulous ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüôè

## Facebook Marketplace Mirrors
- date: 2024-05-07
- description: I was selling a mirror on @facebookmarketplace like a month ago and laughed at myself trying to take a picture of the mirror without capturing my reflection.

- link_text: Watch the Reel!
- images: [fbmirrors.webp]
- tags: [video, social media]

I went through hundreds of listings of second hand mirrors, ran the images through an image expander, and these are some of the haunted favs. Silly little thing.

## Musical Tie
- date: 2024-04-01
- description: Made a silly thing with a children's toy I thrifted‚Ä¶ thinking about dynamics between work and play// professional items and toys.
- link: https://www.instagram.com/p/C5PIpHCRMBo/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
- link_text: See the Tie in Action!
- images: [musictie.webp]
- tags: [wearable, interactive]

I'd wear this if I was invited to a funeral for a musician. Or maybe if I was a server at a bar with live jazz, and had to help the guitarist tune up (swanky style). Anyway, I broke it...

## Engage with Me
- date: 2024-03-03
- description: I stopped posting casual selfies of myself on instagram once it started turning into a page where I shared my freelance work and personal projects.
- link: https://tina.zone/engagewithme
- link_text: Engage with Me
- images: [engagewithme.webp]
- tags: [web, interactive, social commentary]

I'm not exactly sure why. The humorous side of me likes to think it is because it is too easily accessible, and most people do not deserve my awesome selfies. This led to "Engage with Me," a series of steps you must complete before being deemed worthy enough for an old picture of me.

## Happy Test
- date: 2024-02-20
- description: Inspired by the dystopian smile detector Canon installed in their Chinese offices (2021), I temporarily implemented browser-based emotion tracking on my personal website.

- link_text: Happy Test
- images: [happy.webp]
- tags: [web, computer vision, social commentary]

With Google Analytics, I was able to see whether or not people were enjoying their time at tina.zone.

## ‚òÜ Scan Artist
- date: 2024-02-15
- description: A NYFW show that tells a story about the current scourges of the fashion industry through marker-based augmented reality.

- link_text: Learn More
- images: [scanartist.webp]
- tags: [AR, AR.js, A-Frame, Fashion]

This project was presented at New York Fashion Week 2024, using augmented reality to highlight issues in the fashion industry.

## Distance From Source
- date: 2024-01-24
- description: I want the truth. Don't stray from the source. This diary entry obfuscates more the further you are away from the place it was written.
- link: https://tina.zone/distancefromsource/
- link_text: Read my Diary
- images: [distance-source.webp]
- tags: [Web, Geolocation, Interactive Art]

This project explores the concept of truth and proximity, using geolocation to alter the user's experience based on their physical distance from where the content was created.

## Machine Learning Demo with Book Covers

- link: https://tina.zone/asheandru
- link_text: Enjoy the Show!
- images: [couch.webp]
- tags: [web, interactive, animation]

This is an experiment with dialogue and animation. Current fixes needed: the speech is off. I realized you cannot have text to speech for two popups going at the same time, so I tried to improvise with some inputted audio files.

## Worship Me: A Shareable Digital Shrine
- date: 2023-12-10
- description: After a friend with covid jokingly told me to "worship her through the screen," I thought about how I could make a shrine-like website for her.
- link: https://worshipme.tina.zone
- link_text: Build a shrine!
- images: [worship.webp]
- tags: [web, interactive, Node.js]

I notoriously make websites and art projects for the people in my life, so this was a fun challenge. This is my first Node.js application! After uploading a photo, users generate a link to their custom shrines, with buttons allowing you to worship them harder and harder. This custom link is sharable with other people, so they can worship you as well.

## Testing Tina's Vision
- date: 2023-12-15
- description: In an interview with a company, the CEO commented on my glasses and how the lenses are different shapes.

This was a cutesy project I put together in a night.

## Elf Barighian

It is a great demo of placing 3D assets into the real world.

## En Route Super Sized Necklace

- description: Inspired by Viviene Westwood's AR campaign for larger-than-life jewelry in real space.
- images: [enroute.webp]
- tags: [AR, 3D modeling, fashion]

I made a 3D model of one of En Route's best-selling necklaces and got some early pics using meta spark for a real-world world object placement. It's always good for me to have some basic 3D modeling in my freelance practice.

## Pop-up Experiments
- date: 2023-11-06
- description: This piece is meant to be funny and also experimental. It is about how we may seem perfect on paper even if that could not be farther from the truth.
- link: https://tina.zone/abouttina
- link_text: play with popups
- images: [popup.webp]
- tags: [web, interactive, humor]

If you want to try this experience, make sure popups and camera are turned on.

Urging them to remember that the love they've put out into the universe exists inside them.

I was invited to participate, and in addition to some live-coding visuals I did for the performance, I also had this simple html/js animation.

## Magic 8 Ball
- date: 2023-03-25
- description: A simple magic-8 ball I made using my own head, designed to have an old primitive style of animation.

I still use this if I'm unsure.

## AR Portfolio Enhancer
- date: 2023-02-23
- description: A portfolio enhancer I designed using A-frame, that I no longer use on my personal website. 
- link: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C3tbtJ2PYTb/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
- link_text: See what it was like in action! 
- images: [arhelper.webp]
- tags: [AR, A-frame, web]

Instead of having so much text on my projects page, I decided to record casual videos of myself discussing each one.

## Emotions Detector

## Chrome Extension: Stop Buying Things!
- date: 2022-10-05
- description: After discovering the trend of "deinfluencing," I decided to take a stab at the consumerism problem.
- images: [SBTex.webp]
- tags: [chrome extension, social commentary]

I noticed that because of how convenient it has become to order things online, we are consuming much more than we need to. My simple solution to this is a chrome extension I aptly named "Stop Buying Things." By detecting that you are on a shopping cart page, the pop-up turns your browser window red for a few seconds, then reminds you of its simple creed: STOP BUYING THINGS! In the few seconds where your browser is totally red, it will allow you to take a deep breath before truly considering if you need to buy anything.

## Mathy, the Math Cat!
- date: 2022-09-01
- description: An additional skill practice program built for English-speaking 2nd graders.
- images: [mathy.webp]
- tags: [education, web, interactive]

Its purpose is to help students improve their additional skills by encouraging them to get multiple answers in a row. Users answer the displayed arithmetic question, which increases in difficulty every level. Users submit their answer by pressing the submit button, or pressing the enter key on their keyboard. If the user answers correctly, a new problem will be randomly generated.

The number of currently consecutive answers is stored, and it is displayed under "Current Streak" on the webpage. The user's highest streak for the session is also displayed, which is reset when the page is refreshed/a new session starts.

For every correctly answered question, the screen displays "Correct! Great Job!" with an accompanying image of the original avatar, Mathy the Adventure Cat, randomly displaying 1 of 3 positive emotions. Every 10 correct consecutive answers is rewarded with unlocking a new background.

When users enter incorrectly, the current streak is reset to 0, and the question will not change until it is answered correctly. Mathy the Adventure Cat is displayed as having a pensive, thinking face.

When users need help, they can press the help button in the top right of the div container. This alerts the user of some ways to help them solve the problem.

For users who have sight impairments or struggle with dyscalculia, there is a speech-to-text toggle button displayed under the current level.
